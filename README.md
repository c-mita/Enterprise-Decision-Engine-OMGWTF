##Enterprise Decision Making Engine##

####Warning####
This is my entry to the OMG competition at The Daily WTF.
Nothing in this repository should be taken too seriously.


####EDE####
A perfect solution to any binary decision.
Fully automated, with a highly optimised decision engine at its core, the EDE will solve any and all difficult two-way choice for you!
It can even be applied to n-ary decisions! Simply assign each choice a binary number and use the EDE repeatedly.


####Requirements####
Whatever the requirements are for Visual Studio 2010.

Visual Studio 2010 or later.

(Since I'm not sure on whether VS Express has the necessary tools, you may or may not need MinGW installed. You won't if you have VS Professional).



####Overview####
EDE uses a highly optimised (i.e. written in x86 Assembly) Random Number Generator that utilises quantum fluctuations and the non-deterministic nature of an Windows' threading algorithms.
But there's no need to worry about going through the complexities of compiling an assembler program in a C# project! The RNG program is generated at run time!
Provided you have ml.exe and link.exe in your Visual Studio installation folder, or MinGW's version of gcc installed.
