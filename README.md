####EDE####
A perfect solution to any binary decision.
Fully automated, with a highly optimised decision engine at its core, the EDE will solve any and all difficult two-way choice for you!
It can even be applied to n-ary decisions! Simply assign each choice a binary number and use the EDE repeatedly.
